# SimplyShinro
##An Android Studio project for my SimplyShinro Android app

This is an app I'm creating based on my Shinro project at https://github.com/stutonk/shinro.git

All source code is Â© 2015 Joseph Eib. You may use my code for educational puroposes ONLY.

###TODO:
- The code is in desperate need of commentary.
- At some point, I want to implement 'undo move' functionality in the game
- I also want to make it so it saves which puzzles you've completed
